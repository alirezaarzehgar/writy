# Writy

This database is just a practice project and challenge for me. I started it on Nowruz 1404.
Writy is suitable for write-heavy systems. It communicates using gRPC and has an internal
caching system. Writes and reads are stored in the cache first and flushed to the filesystem after a certain time.

# TODO
- [x] master-slave architecture
