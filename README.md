# Writy

This database is just a practice project and challenge for me. I started it on Nowruz 1404.
Writy is suitable for write-heavy systems. It communicates using gRPC and has an internal
caching system. Writes and reads are stored in the cache first and flushed to the filesystem after a certain time.

# TODO
*WARNING: The project is lacking in tests. There are definitely many bugs that will not be easily identified
until tests are written. Due to a lack of time and patience, I couldn't use TDD for the project.
However, from now on, not a single line of code should be changed without a test.
Moving forward, we will definitely dedicate more time to writing tests.*
